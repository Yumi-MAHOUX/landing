	  		<p>
	  		  For the fitness world or for anything else, it is really important to have a goal to get motivation and results. Decide if you want to gain muscle, lose weight, just tone up or just have a healthy routine.

	  		<h2>2.Eating,Not Boring</h2>	
	  		<p>Everything is not only about Sport. If you are not eating accordingly you will not have any results. But eating healthy DOESN'T mean, eating salads and boring things at every meals!! Another very important point, you have to eat what you like not to be frustated! If you are restrictin yourself too much, it's not going to bring anything good.</p>
